### Analysis Objectives
In this case, I'm aiming to use Folium on the BW2 route to help tourists explore Jakarta for free. A visual map makes it simpler to find nearby attractions, historical places, cafes or restaurants, they might want to check out. The map helps us figure out the location of our bus stops compared to where we wanna go. Plus, it's easy to decide which stop to get on and off at based on our current spot using the map. The Jakarta city government's got you covered with their free Tour Bus Service! The routes BW2 (Jakarta Baru) and BW4 (Pencakar Langit) run from 10am to 9pm and cost you nothing. BW2 takes the Juanda Istiqlal route (round trip), and BW4 takes the IRTI Monas route (round trip).

### **What is Folium?**
Folium is a Python library commonly used for visualizing geospatial data on interactive maps. It provides a simple and intuitive way to create maps and overlay various data layers, making it useful for a wide range of data analysis tasks, including crime analysis.

Interactive maps, like those made with Folium, can help you analyze personal data, especially if it has a geographical component. Some specific benefits of using Folium to display bus routes are:
1. **Spatial Data Visualization**: If you show busway routes on a map, you can see how the busses travel. This helps understand the city's bus route coverage and how it compares to other areas.
2. **Route Planning and Optimization**: If you have traffic or passenger density data, you can use it to plan or optimize busway routes. For example, you might find that some routes are busy while others are underutilized, and you can adjust routes or bus schedules to achieve a better balance.
3. **Identification of Underserved Areas**: By comparing busway routes with population maps or other data, city planners or bus operators can identify areas that aren't well-served.
4. **Data Communication and Presentation**: Interactive maps can be easier to understand than numbers or raw data tables.
